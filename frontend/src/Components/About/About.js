                    <p className="aboutDesc">Paso Robles Youth Arts Center is a public non-profit organization founded in 1998 by Donna Berg. We provide nearly 400 students ages 5â€“18 with over fifty weekly classes and serve over 700 students annually. As we grow, our waiting list gets longer and our financial needs grow as well. We need the community to see how important the Youth Arts has become and how necessary it is to help it continue being the unique facility it is. We rely on donations as well as private and public funding and are so grateful for your gifts of any size! </p>
